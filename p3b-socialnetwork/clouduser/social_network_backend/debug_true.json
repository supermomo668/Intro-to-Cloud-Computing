In a BB heavy match, patience is key....you cant afford to get focused, and sometimes this means stalling your engage until BBs are tunneling each other, or trying to fight on an area of the map where you're the biggest, meanest boat - somewhere you can engage DDs and IJN cruisers from range. Try to preserve your hitpoints early to make yourself a less attractive target. Everyone loves shooting at ships that have already lost 1/2 their hp.\n\nThat being said, the Cleveland is a pretty big playstyle change from previous cruisers - you fight more like a (paper) battleship than you do on earlier tier ones. The Pensacola pushes you even further in this direction. Use one turret for a ranging shot, then unload on your targets. If you're being targeted by something bigger than you, try to force them to switch targets before re-engaging. ",

I've seen people complaining about repair bills etc, and I wasn't sure if the game required ongoing cash infusion to keep playing without being too serious a grind. Last question..access to the CBT means i can play as soon as i get it downloaded, right? As I understand the game is currently in CBT, then proceeds to open beta, then wipes progress and goes live?",

Premium vehicles tend to be on par or slightly worse than regular vehicles in WoT, so I expect the same in WoWS.\n4. Yes, depends on how do you define excessive. Not as much for beta testing, but once open beta hits the economy will be restored to normal. In WoT, for example, grinding from tier 1 to tier 10 takes ~700,000 experience. Grinding ships is actually not the most difficult part. The most difficult part is to grind your commander skills, and while you can use your free exp on ships, you can't accelerate your commander grind.\n5. No. Why would you ask?\n6. No advantage. Just different meta game, higher damage, better maneuverability, more dynamic battlefield. This is also why accelerating your grinding with premium time doesn't affect game balance, because grinding only moves you into a different bucket for match making. Plus, who doesn't want an Iowa? High tier ships will also be pretty much required once WoWS equivalent of WoT's Clan Wars show up, so you will need them for certain game modes.",
