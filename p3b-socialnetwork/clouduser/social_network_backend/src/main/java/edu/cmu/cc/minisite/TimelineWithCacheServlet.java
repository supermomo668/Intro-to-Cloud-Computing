/**
 * In this task you will populate a user's timeline.
 * This task helps you understand the concept of fan-out and caching.
 * Practice writing complex fan-out queries that span multiple databases.
 * Also practice using caching mechanism to boost your backend!
 *
 * Task 5 (1):
 * Get the name and profile of the user as you did in Task 3
 * Put them as fields in the result JSON object
 *
 * Task 5 (2);
 * Get the follower name and profiles as you did in Task 4
 * Put them in the result JSON object as one array
 *
 * Task 5 (3):
 * From the user's followees, get the 30 most popular comments
 * and put them in the result JSON object as one JSON array.
 * (Remember to find their parent and grandparent)
 *
 * Task 5 (4):
 * Make sure your implementation can finish a request that is sent
 * before in a short time.
 *
 * The posts should be sorted:
 * First by ups in descending order.
 * Break tie by the timestamp in descending order.
